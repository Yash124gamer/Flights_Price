# Flights_Price
This repository is about the assignment i was given when I applied for an Intership.
In this assignment I had to Create an API in which a Origin City , Destination city and a date for departure is Given as Input and The API will return all the Price from all The Different Airline Services.
I had Used an External API from Rapid API(Sky Scrapper API) for the Prices of Flights.
